title: Hooks
---

Quill Next React provides a set of hooks to help you extend the editor's behavior.

Quill Next provides hooks that are primarily divided into two categories: those used before `QuillEditor`
initialization and those used within `QuillEditor` plugins. You can clearly distinguish them by their names:
all hooks starting with `useQuill` are intended for use within plugins, such as `useQuillFormats()`.
Conversely, hooks not starting with `useQuill` should be used before `QuillEditor` is initialized, such as
`useReactEmbed`.
