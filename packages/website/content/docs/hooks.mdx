Quill Next React provides a set of hooks to help you extend the editor's behavior.

Quill Next provides hooks that are primarily divided into two categories: those used before `QuillEditor`
initialization and those used within `QuillEditor` plugins. You can clearly distinguish them by their names:
all hooks starting with `useQuill` are intended for use within plugins, such as `useQuillFormats()`.
Conversely, hooks not starting with `useQuill` should be used before `QuillEditor` is initialized, such as
`useReactEmbed`.

## Initialization Hooks

### useEmbedBlot

`useEmbedBlot` is the most powerful hook, allowing us to easily extend Quill's embed content with React
components. With this hook, you can readily implement features like mentions.

```tsx
import { useEmbedBlot } from "quill-next-react";

const MyEditor = () => {
  const MentionBlot = useEmbedBlot({
    blotName: "mention",
    tagName: "SPAN",
    className: "qn-mention",
    render: (options: IRenderOptions) => {
      return <Mention value={options.value as string} />;
    },
    onAttach: (domNode: HTMLElement) => {
      domNode.style.whiteSpace = "pre-wrap";
      domNode.style.wordBreak = "break-word";
    }
  });
  return (
    <QuillEditor blots={[MentionBlot]}>
    </QuillEditor>
  )
}
```

#### blotName

Required: `true`

The unique name for your custom blot. This name will be used to identify your blot in the editor.

```tsx
const MyBlot = useEmbedBlot({
  blotName: 'my-custom-blot',
  // ... other props
});
```

#### className

Required: `true`

A CSS class name that Quill will use to identify and match your blot in the editor content.
This class name must be unique and consistent.
Quill will use this class name to find the blot in the editor content.

```tsx
const MyBlot = useEmbedBlot({
  className: 'my-custom-blot-class',
  // ... other props
});
```

#### render

Required: `true`

A function that returns the React component to be rendered for your blot. This is where you define how your custom blot should look and behave.

```tsx
const MyBlot = useEmbedBlot({
  render: () => (
    <div className="my-custom-blot">
      <h3>My Custom Content</h3>
      <p>This is a custom blot rendered with React!</p>
    </div>
  ),
  // ... other props
});
```

#### scope

Required: `false`

Defines the scope of your blot. This determines how the blot behaves in relation to other content in the editor.

```tsx
const MyBlot = useEmbedBlot({
  scope: BlotScope.BLOCK, // or BlotScope.INLINE
  // ... other props
});
```

#### create

Required: `false`

A function that creates the initial DOM element for your blot. This is useful when you need custom initialization logic.

```tsx
const MyBlot = useEmbedBlot({
  create: (value) => {
    const node = document.createElement('div');
    node.setAttribute('data-custom-value', value);
    return node;
  },
  // ... other props
});
```

#### onAttach

Required: `false`

A callback function that runs when your blot is attached to the DOM. This is useful for setting up any necessary event listeners or initializations.

```tsx
const MyBlot = useEmbedBlot({
  onAttach: (domNode) => {
    // Initialize any third-party libraries
    initializeLibrary(domNode);
  },
  // ... other props
});
```

### useNextLinkBlot

### useNextImageBlot

## Plugin Hooks

### useQuill

This hook is the most common hook in the plugin system.
It provides access to the quill instance and the quill editor.

```tsx
const quill = useQuill();
```

### useQuillFormats

### useQuillInput

### useQuillEditorChange

### useQuillTextChange

### useQuillSelectionChange

### useQuillArrowIndex

### useQuillKeyboardBinding
